# Stripped Wordpress
Stripped Wordpress is a modified wordpress install that is intended to allow the rapid development of small sites.

Make sure you use compass to watch the scss folder in the default theme. This compiles all of the CSS files to the main style.css stylesheet.

Find and replace the strings 'stripped-wordpress', 'stripped_wordpress' and 'stripped wordpress' with the name of your site.
